This notebook introduces the practical side of information visualization using Python.  
It builds directly on concepts from previous lectures:

- **InfoVis Introduction** (marks and channels, perception, visual encodings)  
- **Storytelling with Data** (headlines, captions, annotations, structure, clarity)  

Here, you will learn how to turn those principles into working visualizations using  
**pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

The goal is not just to *make a plot* but to **communicate a message clearly and responsibly**.

## Learning Objectives

By working through the notebook, you will learn how to:

### 1. Apply InfoVis concepts in Python
- Choose the right **mark** (point, line, bar)  
- Use effective **channels** (position, length, color, shape)  
- Match chart types to data types  
- Avoid misleading or ineffective design choices  

### 2. Improve the clarity of visualizations
- Use titles, labels, and annotations to guide interpretation  
- Remove chart junk and unnecessary decorations  
- Apply color intentionally and responsibly  
- Reduce visual clutter by controlling precision and formatting  

### 3. Build small, focused data stories
- Load and clean data  
- Create meaningful comparisons  
- Highlight important patterns  
- Export your final visual for reports or assignments  

### 4. Practice responsible visualization
Following ideas from **Tufte**, **Bertin**, **Few**, **Ware**, and **Munzner**, you will learn to  
design visualizations that are:

- accurate  
- honest  
- visually clear  
- perceptually effective  
- narratively meaningful
