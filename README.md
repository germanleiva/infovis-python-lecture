)

This notebook introduces the practical side of information visualization using Python.  
It builds directly on concepts from previous lectures:

- **InfoVis Introduction** (marks and channels, perception, visual encodings)  
- **Storytelling with Data** (headlines, captions, annotations, structure, clarity)  

Here, you will learn how to turn those principles into working visualizations using  
**pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

The goal is not just to *make a plot* but to **communicate a message clearly and responsibly**.

## Learning Objectives

By working through the notebook, you will learn how to:

### 1. Apply InfoVis concepts in Python
- Choose the right **mark** (point, line, bar)  
- Use effective **channels** (position, length, color, shape)  
- Match chart types to data types  
- Avoid misleading or ineffective design choices  

### 2. Improve the clarity of visualizations
- Use titles, labels, and annotations to guide interpretation  
- Remove chart junk and unnecessary decorations  
- Apply color intentionally and responsibly  
- Reduce visual clutter by controlling precision and formatting  

### 3. Build small, focused data stories
- Load and clean data  
- Create meaningful comparisons  
- Highlight important patterns  
- Export your final visual for reports or assignments  

### 4. Practice responsible visualization
Following ideas from **Tufte**, **Bertin**, **Few**, **Ware**, and **Munzner**, you will learn to  
design visualizations that are:

- accurate  
- honest  
- visually clear  
- perceptually effective  
- narratively meaningful

## How to Open the Notebook

### **Fastest option — Click the Colab button at the top**  
It will open directly in Google Colab:

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GbwCD7eeadechSy8X44VE0lWWpU2RXo
_

### Option B — Manual upload  
1. Download the `.ipynb` file  
2. Go to https://colab.research.google.com  
3. Select **Upload**  
4. Choose the notebook file  
5. Run all cells

### Option C — From the Colab “Drive” tab  
If the notebook is in your own Google Drive:  
1. Go to Colab  
2. Choose **Google Drive** tab  
3. Select your notebook to open it

## Before You Start

This notebook assumes you already know:

- basic Python syntax  
- how to run cells in a Jupyter environment  
- what marks, channels, and visual encodings are  
- the purpose of data storytelling and why clarity matters  

If any of these topics feel unclear, review the InfoVis and Storytelling slides first.

## What You Should Pay Attention To

As you work through the examples, keep asking:

### “What is the message of this chart?”  
### “Do my design decisions support that message?”

Pay attention to:

- Which channels (position, length, color) carry meaning  
- What the viewer should notice first  
- Whether the plot is simpler than it can be  
- Whether color reinforces meaning or distracts  
- How annotations focus attention on the insight that matters  

Your goal is not visual complexity.  
Your goal is **clarity, integrity, and intention**.

---

## Final Exercise

At the end of the notebook, you will complete a small task:

### **Create one visualization that communicates one clear message.**

Your plot must include:

- a descriptive title  
- axis labels  
- at least one annotation  
- clean formatting (no chart junk)  
- appropriate color use  

You must also write a short explanation describing:

1. What the main message is  
2. Why you chose that chart type  
3. Which visual channels encode which attributes  
4. How you applied at least one principle from  
   **Bertin, Tufte, Ware, Few, or Munzner**

This prepares you for your **Storytelling With Data** assignment later in the course.

## Good luck — and design with purpose

Good visualization is not decoration.  
It is **helping someone understand something important**.

If you build with intention, the code will follow.
